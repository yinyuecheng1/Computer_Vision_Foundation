# Edge Detection Syllabus
## Edge detection
- Goal: Identify sudden changes(discontinuities) in an image.
- Intuitively, most semantic and shape information from the image can be encoded in the edges.
- More compact than pixels.
- Meaning: Extract information, recognize objects; Recover geometry and viewpoint.


## Image Gradients
- In fact: Discrete Derivative

## A simple edge detector
### Sobel edge detector
### Canny edge detector
## Hough Transform
