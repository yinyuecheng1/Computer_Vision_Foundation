## Image Histogram

Histogram of an image provides `the frequency of the brightness(intensity) value` in the image.

```
def histogram(im):
  h = np.zeros(255)
  for row in im.shape[0]:
    for col in im.shape[1]:
      val = im[row, col]
      h[val] += 1
```

## Systems and Filters
### Filtering
Forming a new image whose pixel values are transformed from original pixel values.
Goal is to extract useful information from images, or transform images into another domain where we can modify/enhance image properties.
- Features (edges, corners, blobsâ€¦)
- super-resolution; in-painting; de-noising

###  linear shift invariant system
- Details in the CS131 slides.
## Convolution and correlation

### Convolution
- X-flip the convolution filter.
- Y-flip the convolution filter.
- Innerproduct with the origin image.

### Cross correlation
- Equivalent to a convolution without the flip.

## Convolution vs. (Cross) Correlation

- A `convolution` is an integral that expresses the amount of overlap of one function
as it is shifted over another function. convolution is a filtering operation.

- `Correlation` compares the similarity of two sets of data. Correlation computes a
measure of similarity of two input signals as they are shifted by one another. The
correlation result reaches a maximum at the time when the two signals match
best. correlation is a measure of relatedness of two signals.
